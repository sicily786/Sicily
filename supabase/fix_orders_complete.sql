-- Safe to re-run: drops conflicting policies first, then recreates everything
-- needed for guest/logged-in checkout to work end to end.
--
-- IMPORTANT: if inserts still fail with "new row violates row-level
-- security policy" even though the policy/grants look correct, check
-- whether the `authenticator` role has been granted the ability to
-- SET ROLE into `anon`/`authenticated`. This project's authenticator
-- role was missing that grant, which made PostgREST silently fail to
-- switch roles and run every request under a role with no matching
-- policies. Fix:
--   GRANT anon TO authenticator WITH INHERIT TRUE, SET TRUE;
--   GRANT authenticated TO authenticator WITH INHERIT TRUE, SET TRUE;
